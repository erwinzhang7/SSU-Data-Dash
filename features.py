"""EDIT ME: turn a table of homes into numbers a model can learn from.

Each function gets a table of homes with the columns of its test file (so never
sold_price or date_sold) and returns a table of numbers, one row per home.
FeatureModel in models.py uses them; switch it on in make_model() to try your features.

Ideas to try:
- lot size: lot_front * lot_depth (empty for condos, which is fine for tree models)
- garage, house_style, municipality
- how pricey a community is: the median price per square foot of its past sales
  (work it out from the training sales only, never from the homes you predict)
- how prices have moved recently in the area or for that property type
- words in the remarks, such as "renovated" or "needs work"
- off-market and list-aware can use different features: list-aware has list_price
