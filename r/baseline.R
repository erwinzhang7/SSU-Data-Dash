# Baseline predictions in R, for students who prefer R to Python.
#
# Does the same as `python run.py predict` with the two starting models:
#   list-aware: every home sells for exactly its list price
#   off-market: the median sold price of the 10 nearest earlier sales of the same type
# and writes the same two files: submissions/submission_off_market.csv and
# submissions/submission_list_aware.csv.
#
# 1. Download listings.csv, test_off_market.csv and test_list_aware.csv from
#    https://huggingface.co/datasets/Baliyang/SSU_data_dash ("Files and versions" tab).
# 2. Set data_dir below to the folder they are in.
# 3. From the repo folder, run:  Rscript r/baseline.R   (or open it in RStudio and click Source)
# Only base R is needed. data.table::fread() reads the files faster, if you have it.
